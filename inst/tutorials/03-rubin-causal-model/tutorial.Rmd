## What is a causal effect?

```{r quiz1, echo=FALSE}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - Causal Effects",
  question("What is the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference?",
    answer("It is impossible to observe multiple potential outcomes at once.", correct = TRUE, message = "Nice!"),
    answer("We don't know the potential outcomes for people not surveyed.", message = "Close, missing data is at the heart of inference, but this is not the Fundamental Problem of *Causal* Inference."), 
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("How do we estimate causal effect?",
    answer("Observe someone's potential outcome under treatment and compare it to their potential outcome as control.", message = "Remember the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference is that we cannot *observe* both potential outcomes, but you're on the right track."),
    answer("Only through lots of complicated coding.", message = "We can describe the process of finding the causal effect without any real code!"),
    answer("Find the difference between potential outcomes under treatment and potential outcomes under control.", correct = TRUE),
